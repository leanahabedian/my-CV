Title & \textbf{Hot-Swap: A technique for generate and update discrete controller Synthesis at runtime}\\
Supervisors &  \textit{Professor Nicol\'as D'Ippolito}\\
Description & Continuous operation is a need for sound engineering techniques 
that can change a system without stopping or disturbing
its operation in the face of environment and requirements changes.

We address the dynamic controller update problem when the specification (both 
environment assumptions and requirements) of the current system change.

We present a general solution that not only produces a controller that computes a controller for the new specification
and handles the transition from one to another but also, unlike existing approaches, assures that the system will reach
a state in which such a transition can correctly occur. Indeed, using controller synthesis we show how to automatically build a
controller that guarantees both progress towards update and also a safe update.\\

\subsubsection*{Participation in Projects}

\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
Mar 2014 Jun 2014 & \textbf{Research Assistant}, \textit{National Institute of Informatics}, Tokyo, Japan\\
& \vspace{-0.7cm} Research in Software engineering in controller synthesis with an approach of self-adaptive software. I develop a new
technique in the MTSA tool so as to build controllers that allow the change of 
the environment and ensure new goals
without rebooting the system.

The work done on my thesis begins from this internship that was held in Tokyo, 
Japan and supervised by Professors Nicol\'as
D'Ippolito and Kenji Tei. The tool MTSA was developed in \textsc{java} 
(\url{http://mtsa.dc.uba.ar}).\\

\subsubsection*{Human Resources Training}

\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
Mar 2015 -- & \textbf{Director of Master Thesis}, \textit{Universidad de Buenos Aires}, Argentina\\
& Victor Wjugow did an internship in the National 
Institute of Informatics, Japan, extending my master thesis work.
 
Controllers that can manage many updates without having a bloating controller 
are produced by the technique we are working on. These
updates can be updated when the environment in which they are running change,  
the goals to be satisfy are impossible
to achieve or the system acquire new abilities and it needs to exploit them. 
How to handle many updates without disrupting or stopping the execution is a 
common question in the self-adaptation software area.\\

Ene 2015 Jun 2017 & \textbf{Director of Master Thesis}, \textit{Universidad de Buenos Aires}, 
Argentina\\
& \vspace{-0.7cm} I directed Ivan Pasquini for getting his Master degree. Title: ``Localización y 
modelado simultáneos mediante generación y actualización automática de controladores discretos''.

Our work presents a novelty solution for problems where properties of the environment are not completely known. We direct to explore that environment so as to get only the information needed to solve the problem. This work has many applications in the area of robotics, networks, etc.\\

\section*{Industrial Experience}

\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
Nov 2012 Apr 2015 & \textbf{Project Leader / Software engineer}, 
\textit{National Ministry of Interior}, Argentina\\
& \vspace{-0.7cm} I coped with different projects that requires programming in 
many languages. Mainly, I used to work with \textsc{python}
but also I worked with \textsc{java} and \textsc{php}. 

Then, I also work as a Project leader. We developed a system for assigning the 
time that each media outlet gave to each political party for
their advertising campaign for 2013 and 2015 Argentine elections. Our system also provide a web application that allow the media outlets and the
political parties to communicate between them, so as to decide which TV spot they will use and when.\\

%------------------------------------------------
May 2012 Oct 2012 & \textbf{Python developer}, \textit{Core Security Technologies}, Buenos Aires, Argentina\\
& \vspace{-0.7cm} Company that develops software for analysis of 
vulnerabilities. My work consist in developing a system for adding, 
removing or editing tasks in \textsc{unix} crontab file.

Another project was to initiate a server in a virtual machine with \textsc{openBSD} to be used as a web server. To
achieve this goal I had to install all the packages needed to build a web service.\\


%------------------------------------------------
May 2010 Dic 2011 & \textbf{ActionScript2/Python developer}, \textit{MetroGames}, Buenos Aires, Argentina\\
& \vspace{-0.7cm} Company that makes video games for social networks. I was one of the developers of a particular game called Fashion
World. The design patter that we used to implement that game was \textsc{mvc} and the language was
\textsc{ActionScript2}.

Afterwards, I worked with \textsc{python} to make internal systems to be used 
within the company. These programs were part of the
internal infrastructure of the company. For instance, a system that manage the deployment of a project. \\


%------------------------------------------------
Feb 2010 May 2010 & \textbf{Web developer}, \textit{Intelligenx}, Buenos Aires, Argentina\\
& \vspace{-0.7cm} I did an internship for this company where I had two projects.

Firstly, we produced a tool for web scrapping different pages using
\textsc{xpath} and \textsc{regular expressions}. By doing this, the tool fills a
database with information about many companies stores such as address, names, 
etc.

After that, we produced a web page that use obtained data for providing yellow 
pages service. We used \textsc{java/hibernate} to create the application. \\
