\section{Other Knowledge}

\subsection{Programming}

\hspace{0.4cm}
I have a good knowledge in programming. The languages that I usually use is Python, Ruby, C++, Java and assembler,
even though my studies provide me facility to learn another language. Also, I use xpath and regular expressions.
I have used agile methodology in the academy so as to learn how it works. For example,
\textbf{Scrum}, \textbf{Extreme Programing}, etc.

Also, I have other skills that allow programing easier such as using version control system, for example  \textbf{SVN}, \textbf{Mercurial} and \textbf{Git}.

Moreover, I have a strong knowledge in the internal structure of a computer with technology IA-32 (Intel Architecture of 32 bits).

Finally, I usually give importance to my presentations, so I recommend and use $\LaTeX$ to do them. An example could be this Curriculum Vitae that you are reading.


\subsection{Configuration of Operating Systems}

\hspace{0.4cm}
Some subjects in the university aim to the functionality of the operating systems, studying each component separately, such as, the Memory Management Unit (MMU), I/O unit, scheduler, etc. and also studying the functionality of distributed systems using well-known algorithm. 
Also, I have experience in programing with threads or multi-process, using IPC (inter-process communication), locking and other techniques to handle problems that arise when using more than one thread of execution.

Other subject of interest for me, is the study of security in computers, even though I have not got experience, I would like to learn more about this concepts. Finally, I would like to add that I am home user of Ubuntu Linux operating system since 2009
