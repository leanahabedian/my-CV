\section{Other Knowledge}

\subsection{Programming}

\hspace{0.4cm}
I have a good knowledge in programming. The languages that I usually use is Python, Ruby, C++, Java and asembler,
even though my studies provide me facility to learn another language. Also, I use xpath and regular expressions.
I have used agile methodology in the academy so as to learn how it works. For example,
\textbf{Scrum}, \textbf{Extreme Programing}, etc.

Also, I have other skills that makes the programmation easier like using version control system, such as  \textbf{SVN}, \textbf{Mercurial} and \textbf{Git}.

Moreover, I have a strong knowledge in the internal structure of a computer with tecnology IA-32 (Intel Arquitecture of 32 bits).

Finally, I usually give importance to a good presentation of my publications, so I recommend and use $\LaTeX$ to do them. An example could be this Curr√≠culum Vitae that you are reading.


\subsection{Configuration of Operating Systems}

\hspace{0.4cm}
Some of subjects in the university aim to the functionality of the operating systems, studing each component separately, such as, the Memory Management Unit (MMU), I/O unit, scheduler, etc. and also studing the functionality of distributed systems using well-known algorithm. 
Also, I have experience in programing with threads or multi-process, using IPC (inter-process comunication), locking and other techniques to handle problems that arise when using more than one thread of execution.

Other subject of interest for me, is the study of security in computers, even though I have not got experience, I would like to learn more about this concepts. Finally, I would like to add that I am also home user of Ubuntu Linux operating system since 2009
