  \textsc{Mar 2014} & Research assistant in software engineering at \textsc{National Institute of Informatics}, Japan \\
  \textsc{Jun 2014} &\emph{Topic: Controller synthesis with a focus on self-adaptive software}\\
  &\footnotesize{I developed a new feature  in the MTSA tool so as to build controllers for systems, that allow the
  change of the environment and satisfy new requirements without rebooting the machine. This internship was held in
  Tokyo, Japan, and supervised by Ph.D. Nicol√°s D'Ippolito and Ph.D. Kenji Tei.
  
  The tool MTSA was developed in \textsc{Java} and you can download it in \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtsa}} \\
