 \emph{Current} & Project Leader at \textsc{Ministry of Interior}, Argentina \\
 \textsc{Nov 2011} & \emph{Project Leader / Python Developer}\\
 &\footnotesize{The assignment of time that each media outlet will give to each political party for the 2013 and 2015
 Argentine elections was my responsibility. It was difficult to distribute the media outlet time because we had to
 ensure some restrictions about the maximum and the minimum amount of time we had to give to each political party.
 
 Before becoming project leader I worked on this project and others by writing \textsc{Python} code. For instance, I
 had to handle transactions made by using the SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico) card. Is the card used for
 traveling in train, subway or bus in Argentina. These cards generates a lot of records that we had to manage properly
 so as to generate some reports weekly, monthly and yearly.} \\
